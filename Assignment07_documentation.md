# Pickling and Exception Handling Documentation

## Introduction
In this week’s lesson, two power tools were explored in exception handling and pickling. Through exception handling, you can anticipate potential errors that users my commit on to the code and provide a detailed explanation on how to best troubleshoot as opposed to allow Python to provide its generic feedback. Pickling allows the user to store their data into binary form which may serve as simple protection and size saving. This is not an encryption technique and should not be employed as such.

## Pickling
Through web searching, the following website served as a good secondary source to the lecture as it gives a very simple explanation while going through the necessary inputs to utilize the pickle module:

The following figure shows implementation of pickling through my usage. I start by importing pickle which brings in the module. I store in my interests for breakfast, lunch and dinner in a list for the respective variables. Next I dump or pickle my lists into my dat file. I store each list into a new line of the dat file.

## Summary
This week’s lesson sought to understand the concepts of pickling and exception handling. Through pickling, it is possible to store the information into binary form which can be stored until later use. Exception handling will prove to be a useful tool in the future as it will help future users identify trouble in code execution without consulting the creator through detailed explanations.
